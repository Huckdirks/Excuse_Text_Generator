## Introduction



## Uses



## Running

### Dependencies

#### Install

Double click `dependencies`, or run `bash dependencies` or `./dependencies` in the root directory or to install the python dependencies. You must have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed to download the new dependencies. Also, you'll need to install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) yourself if you haven't already.

**[List of Dependecies](DEPENDENCIES.md)**

### Running

**YOU HAVE TO INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES BEFORE TRYING TO RUN THE PROGRAM!!!**

Run `python3 text_excuse_generator.py` or `python3 text_excuse_generator.py [sender] [recipient] [problem] [excuse]` in the command line in the root directory.

E.g. `python3 text_excuse_generator.py Me "Your mom" "I'm late to ðŸ˜ˆ" "Too many wizards around"`

## Quality Assurance
All variable, function, classe, module, & file names are written in [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) to make sure everything is consistent, and all `const` variables are written in ALL-CAPS. The code is also quite commented and the variable names are quite verbose, so it should be easy enough to understand what's going on.

If there are any other/better ways to check for quality assurance, please let me know in the [suggestions](https://github.com/Huckdirks/Wikipedia_Links_Graph/discussions/new?category=suggestions)!
